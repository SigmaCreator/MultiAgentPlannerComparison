**** BUILDING *******

The script "build" compiles everything needed, i.e.:

- Compiles the planner FD for a 64 bits machine, in case of 32 bits machines you have to change all the Makefile files under directory planning/fd, replacing all
  occurrences of -m64 by -m32
- Generates the SBCL image map-core using 6G (like in the IPC 2011). In case your machine has less memory remove the --dynamic-space-size 6000 from the script

****** EXECUTING *********

The script "run-map.sh" executes the planner (see it for usage details). 
The script "plan" contais the paramenters needed to execute the versions that participated in CODMAP
