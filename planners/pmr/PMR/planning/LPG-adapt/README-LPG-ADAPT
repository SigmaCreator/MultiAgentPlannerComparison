LPG is a fully automated system for solving planning problems specified
using version 2.2 (2004) of the standard planning language PDDL. LPG-td 
is a new version of LPG including several extensions and improvements. 
LPG-td supports Timed Initial Literals and Derived Predicates, the two 
main new features of PDDL2.2.
LPG-adapt is a version of LPG-td that can be used to solve adaptation
planning problems.

"lpg-adapt-linux.tar.gz" is a complied version for Linux (Debian 3.0)


1. Installing the Compiled Code
-------------------------------


- Copy lpg-adapt-linux.tar.gz into the directory where you want to have the 
  planner.

- From this directory run

      gunzip lpg-adapt-linux.tar.gz 
      tar xvf lpg-adapt-linux.tar 

  README-LPG-ADAPT  -- this file 
  lpg-adapt         -- the executable code of the planner
  DriverLog-Time-pfile20 -- a directory containing variants of the 
  	    	   DriverLog Time pfile20 planning problem used in the
                   3th International Planning Competition (IPC) 2002. 


2. Running LPG-adapt
-----------------

2.1 Necessary Settings

In order to run the program (lpg-adapt) it is necessary to specify the value
of three parameters indicating: (a) a file containing a set of PDDL2.2
operators; (b) a file containing a planning problem (initial state and
goals of the problem) formalized in PDDL2.2; and (c) a running mode, 
which is either "speed", "quality" or "incremental quality" (also called
"bestquality"). 
(a) and (b) must be specified using

  -o <operator file name> 
  -f <problem file name>
  -input_plan <solution file name>
  -n <max number of desired solutions>

  In the incremental mode, LPG-adapt finds a sequence of solutions, each of
  which is written in a file with the standard name

     plan_<problem file name>_<solution number>.SOL

  When the number "x" of solutions specified for the incremental mode is 
  greater than 1, each solution computed is an improvement with respect to 
  the previous one (in terms of the plan metric indicated in the problem 
  file).  
  Note that only the last solution that is computed is shown on the screen 
  (while each solution is written in a different file).
  Moreover, x is an upper bound: it can happen that the system never finds 
  x solutions -- for example, because the i-th solution found (i < x) is 
  the best solution of the planning problem under consideration). 
  If LPG-adapt cannot find x solutions, it stops when it reaches the 
  CPU-time upper bound.   
  You can force lpg-adapt to optimize considering only the "plan
  differences" w.r.t the input plan using the
  "-optimize_plan_differences" setting as described below.


  For example, "./lpg-adapt -o domain.pddl -f pfile-I5-G5-n1.pddl   
  -input_plan solution.sol  -n 3" runs LPG-adapt using the operators 
  specified in operator-file to produce (at most) three plans solving 
  the problem specified in problem-file.

===========================================================================


2.2 Optional Settings

LPG-adapt supports several additional settings, each of which has its own
default value.

  -p <string>

This option can be used to specify the path name of the directory containing 
the file of the operators and the file of the problem definition.  
Example: lpg-adapt -p /home/LPG/domains/ -o op-file-name -f p-file-name -speed

  -out <string> 

This option can be used to change the default name of the files containing 
the plans computed by LPG-adapt. 
For example, "lpg -o op-file-name -f p-file-name -n 2 -out myplan" produces 
two files (assuming that the planner finds two solutions) named 
"myplan_1.SOL" and "myplan_2.SOL".

  -noout

With this option no output file is produced.

  -v off

This option switches off the verbose output of LPG (the planner provides
only essential information).

  -search_steps <integer> 

Specifies the initial number of search steps after which the search is
restarted. After each search restart, this number is automatically 
incremented by a factor of 1.1. The default initial value for -search_steps 
is 500.  Note that for simple problems this value could be significantly 
reduced, obtaining better performance.

  -restarts <integer>

Specifies the maximum number of search restarts after which the search 
is repeated for a certain number of times (see the "-repeat" parameter).
After each restart, the value of some dynamic parameters (e.g., number 
of search step) is automatically changed. The default value of -restarts 
is 9.

  -repeats <integer>

Specifies the maximum number of times (repeats) the local search is
repeated to find the first solution. If no solution has been found within
the specified number of repeats (and the CPU-time limit for the local
search has not been exceeded), the best-first search is activated.
Each time the local search is repeated, the dynamic settings of the
planner (e.g., the number of search steps) are set to their initial value.
When LPG-adapt is run in quality mode or incremental mode ("-n x", x > 1), 
if a solution is found by the local search (under the specified CPU-time
limit and number of repeats), the local search is repeated until the
CPU-time limit of the local search is reached, or the number of solutions
specified by the "-n" parameter have been found. 
The default value of -repeats is 5.

  -noise <number between 0 and 1>

Specifies the initial noise value for Walkplan. Such value is dynamically
modified during each restart using a technique described in in Gerevini,
Saetti, Serina "An Empirical Analysis of Some Heuristic Features for Local 
Search in LPG", ICAPS'04. The default value of -noise is 0.1.

  -maxnoise

Specifies the maximum noise value that can (automatically) be reached by
the dynamic noise. 

  -static_noise

Switches off the dynamic noise during each restart. The value of the 
noise is fixed. The default value is 0.1, and it can be changed by using
the "-noise" parameter.

  -seed <integer>

Specifies the seed for the random number generator used by Walkplan 
(a stochastic local search procedure). By using the same seed number, 
it is possible to repeat identical runs. The output files containing the
solutions produced by LPG include the seed number used by the planner to
generate them. In the 4th IPC, we used "-seed 2004".

  -lowmemory              

With this option, the mutex relations between actions are computed at 
runtime (instead of being computed before searching). We recommend the 
use of this option only for very large problems.

  -cputime <number>       

Specifies the maximum CPU-time (in seconds) after which termination of 
the planning process is forced. The default value is 1800 (30 minutes).

  -cputime_localsearch <number>    

When all restarts of the local search have been performed without finding
a solution, LPG runs in a best-first search based on Joerg Hoffman's
implementation (FF package v2.3). This option specifies the maximum
CPU-time (in seconds) after which the best-first search starts. 
The default value is 1200 (20 minutes).

  -optimize_plan_differences
Forces the optimization phase of lpg-adat to consider as metric
the  "plan differences" (in terms of number of different actions) 
of the current solution plan w.r.t the input plan.


  -optimize_differences_quality
Forces lpg-adat to optimize considering a linear combination of the
metric specified in the planning problem and the  "plan differences" 
of the current solution plan w.r.t the input plan.
